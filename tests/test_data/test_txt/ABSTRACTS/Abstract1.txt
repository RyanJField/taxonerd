A study on pathological effects of Acholeplasma laidlawii isolated from buffaloes in Mice Model. -- Respiratory distress has become a hot issue that is causing severe infection in livestock industry of Pakistan. The exact and timely diagnosis is incredible to treat the disease. However, Acholeplasma (A.) laidlawii is found very significant from buffalo lungs but being a ubiquitous organism, its pathogenic description is not completely understood. The study was designed to validate the involvement of A. laidlawii in respiratory diseases in buffaloes. For this purpose, experimental trials on mice were conducted to confirm the involvement of the organism in respiratory tract infection. It was re-isolated from experimentally infected mice, showing lesions in respiratory tract (83.3%), proving Koch's postulates. Statistically, the experimental group-A (subcutaneous route) showed significant difference (P < 0.05) except in case of mortality feature. The group-B (intraperitoneal route) indicated non-significant difference (P>0.05) in all cases. Based on current study, it may be concluded that the organism is opportunistic, and can produce either disease or lesions on targeted organs in stressed animals, particularly buffaloes.
