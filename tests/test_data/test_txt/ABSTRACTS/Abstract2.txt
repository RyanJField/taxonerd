Rapid identification of Burkholderia pseudomallei and Burkholderia mallei by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) from culture and paraffin-embedded tissue samples -- We evaluated newly developed probes for rapid identification of Burkholderia (B.) pseudomallei and B. mallei and differentiation from B. thailandensis by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). FISH correctly identified 100% of the tested B. pseudomallei (11), B. mallei (11), and B. thailandensis (1) strains, excluded 100% of all tested negative controls (61), and allowed demonstration of B. pseudomallei infection in a paraffin-embedded spleen tissue sample of an experimentally infected mouse.
