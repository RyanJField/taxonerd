Description: TaxoNERD is a domain-specific tool for recognizing taxon mentions in the biodiversity literature.
  - TaxoNERD is available as a command-line tool, a Python module, a spaCy pipeline, and a R package.
  - TaxoNERD provides two models : en_core_eco_md uses spaCy's standard Tok2Vec layer with word vectors for speed, while en_core_eco_biobert uses a Transformer-based pretrained language model (dmis-lab/biobert-v1.1) for accuracy.
  - TaxoNERD finds scientific names, common names, abbreviated species names and user-defined abbreviations.
  - TaxoNERD can link taxon mentions to entities in a reference taxonomy (NCBI Taxonomy, GBIF Backbone and TAXREF at the moment, more to come).
  - TaxoNERD is fast (once the model is loaded), and can run on CPU or GPU.
  - Entity linking does not need an internet connection, but may require a lot of RAM depending on the size of the taxonomy (e.g. GBIF Backbone -> ~12.5Gb).
  - Thanks to textract, TaxoNERD can extract taxon mentions from (almost) any document (including txt, pdf, csv, xls, jpg, png, and many other formats).
