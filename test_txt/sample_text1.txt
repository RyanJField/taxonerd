The pinewood nematode (PWN), Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, is the causative agent of pine wilt disease (PWD), which affects pine forests worldwide and leads to huge economic losses. Serratia strains were found to be widely associated with the PWN and its insect vector, and can be considered a key component in the PWD complex. Serratia grimesii BXF1 was isolated from the PWN, and increased its reproduction. However, strain BXF1 can also act as a plant-growth promoting pine endophyte with fungal and bacterial antagonist activities, further indicating is opportunistic colonization abilities and complex interactions in a wide range of trophic relationship.
